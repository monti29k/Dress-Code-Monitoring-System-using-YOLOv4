# Dress-Code-Monitoring-System-using-YOLOv4
A Framework for Dress Code Monitoring System using Transfer Learning from Pre-Trained YOLOv4 Model

• Developed a model for detecting dress code in workplaces and educational institutions using CNN-based object detection.

• Used transfer learning from YOLOv4 to train the model using Google's Open Image Dataset V7, achieving a mean average 
prediction accuracy of 76.13%.

• Used computer vision, deep learning, and data preprocessing techniques, contributing to the development of a practical and 
effective solution for maintaining proper attire in formal setting.
